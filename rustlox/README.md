# rustlox

rustlox is a complete implementation of the Lox programming language as
presented in Robert Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) implemented as a
tree-walk interpreter.

Instead of just passively reading the book I decided to code along in Rust.
This is the result.
